# DLR

DLR is a compact, common runtime for deep learning models and decision tree models compiled by [AWS SageMaker Neo](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/neo/), [TVM](https://tvm.ai/), or [Treelite](https://treelite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). DLR uses the TVM runtime, Treelite runtime, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and can include other hardware-specific runtimes. DLR provides unified Python/C++ APIs for loading and running compiled models on various devices. DLR currently supports platforms from Intel, NVIDIA, and ARM, with support for Xilinx, Cadence, and Qualcomm coming soon.

## Installation
On X86_64 targets running Linux, you can install latest release of DLR package via 

`pip install dlr`

For installation of DLR on non-x86 edge devices, or building DLR from source, please refer to [Installing DLR](https://neo-ai-dlr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
