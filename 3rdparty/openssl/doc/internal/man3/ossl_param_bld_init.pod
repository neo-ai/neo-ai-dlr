=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of utility functions that simplify the creation of OSSL_PARAM
arrays.  The B<I<TYPE>> names are as per L<OSSL_PARAM_int(3)>.

ossl_param_bld_init() initialises the OSSL_PARAM_BLD structure so that values
can be added.
Any existing values are cleared.

ossl_param_bld_to_param() converts a built up OSSL_PARAM_BLD structure
I<bld> into an allocated OSSL_PARAM array.
The OSSL_PARAM array and all associated storage must be freed by calling
ossl_param_bld_free() with the functions return value.

ossl_param_bld_free() deallocates the memory allocated by
ossl_param_bld_to_param().

=begin comment

POD is pretty good at recognising function names and making them appropriately
bold...  however, when part of the function name is variable, we have to help
the processor along

=end comment

B<ossl_param_bld_push_I<TYPE>>() are a series of functions which will create
OSSL_PARAM objects of the specified size and correct type for the I<val>
argument.
I<val> is stored by value and an expression or auto variable can be used.

ossl_param_bld_push_BN() is a function that will create an OSSL_PARAM object
that holds the specified BIGNUM I<bn>.
If I<bn> is marked as being securely allocated, its OSSL_PARAM representation
will also be securely allocated.
The I<bn> argument is stored by reference and the underlying BIGNUM object
must exist until after ossl_param_bld_to_param() has been called.

ossl_param_bld_push_BN_pad() is a function that will create an OSSL_PARAM object
that holds the specified BIGNUM I<bn>.
The object will be padded to occupy exactly I<sz> bytes, if insufficient space
is specified an error results.
If I<bn> is marked as being securely allocated, its OSSL_PARAM representation
will also be securely allocated.
The I<bn> argument is stored by reference and the underlying BIGNUM object
must exist until after ossl_param_bld_to_param() has been called.

ossl_param_bld_push_utf8_string() is a function that will create an OSSL_PARAM
object that references the UTF8 string specified by I<buf>.
If the length of the string, I<bsize>, is zero then it will be calculated.
The string that I<buf> points to is stored by reference and must remain in
scope until after ossl_param_bld_to_param() has been called.

ossl_param_bld_push_octet_string() is a function that will create an OSSL_PARAM
object that references the octet string specified by I<buf> and <bsize>.
The memory that I<buf> points to is stored by reference and must remain in
scope until after ossl_param_bld_to_param() has been called.

ossl_param_bld_push_utf8_ptr() is a function that will create an OSSL_PARAM
object that references the UTF8 string specified by I<buf>.
If the length of the string, I<bsize>, is zero then it will be calculated.
The string I<buf> points to is stored by reference and must remain in
scope until the OSSL_PARAM array is freed.

ossl_param_bld_push_octet_ptr() is a function that will create an OSSL_PARAM
object that references the octet string specified by I<buf>.
The memory I<buf> points to is stored by reference and must remain in
scope until the OSSL_PARAM array is freed.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ossl_param_bld_to_param() returns the allocated OSSL_PARAM array, or NULL
on error.

All of the ossl_param_bld_push_TYPE functions return 1 on success and 0
on error.

=head1 NOTES

The constant B<OSSL_PARAM_BLD_MAX> specifies the maximum number of parameters
that can be added.
Exceeding this will result in the push functions returning errors.

The structure B<OSSL_PARAM_BLD> should be considered opaque and subject to
change between versions.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Both examples creating an OSSL_PARAM array that contains an RSA key.
For both, the predefined key variables are:

    BIGNUM *p, *q;  /* both prime */
    BIGNUM *n;      /* = p * q */
    unsigned int e; /* exponent, usually 65537 */
    BIGNUM *d;      /* e^-1 */

=head2 Example 1

This example shows how to create an OSSL_PARAM array that contains an RSA
private key.

    OSSL_PARAM_BLD bld;
    OSSL_PARAM *params;

    ossl_param_bld_init(&bld, &secure);
    if (!ossl_param_bld_push_BN(&bld, "p", p)
        || !ossl_param_bld_push_BN(&bld, "q", q)
        || !ossl_param_bld_push_uint(&bld, "e", e)
        || !ossl_param_bld_push_BN(&bld, "n", n)
        || !ossl_param_bld_push_BN(&bld, "d", d)
        || (params = ossl_param_bld_to_param(&bld)) == NULL)
        goto err;
    /* Use params */
    ...
    ossl_param_bld_free(params);

=head2 Example 2

This example shows how to create an OSSL_PARAM array that contains an RSA
public key.

    OSSL_PARAM_BLD bld;
    OSSL_PARAM *params;

    ossl_param_bld_init(&bld, &secure);
    if (!ossl_param_bld_push_BN(&bld, "n", n)
        || !ossl_param_bld_push_BN(&bld, "d", d)
        || (params = ossl_param_bld_to_param(&bld)) == NULL)
        goto err;
    /* Use params */
    ...
    ossl_param_bld_free(params);
