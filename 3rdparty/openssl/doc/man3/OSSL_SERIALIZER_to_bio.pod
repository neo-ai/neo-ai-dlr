=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_SERIALIZER_to_bio() runs the serialization process for the
context I<ctx>, with the output going to the B<BIO> I<out>.  The
application is required to set up the B<BIO> properly, for example to
have it in text or binary mode if that's appropriate.

=for comment Know your serializer!

OSSL_SERIALIZER_to_fp() does the same thing as OSSL_SERIALIZER_to_bio(),
except that the output is going to the B<FILE> I<fp>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_SERIALIZER_to_bio() and OSSL_SERIALIZER_to_fp() return 1 on
success, or 0 on failure.
